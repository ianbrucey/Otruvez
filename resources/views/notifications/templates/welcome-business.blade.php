<p class="notification-text">Now that you've created your business, it's time to get setup. Here's how it works</p>
<ol class="notification-list">
    <li>1) Go the <a class="theme-color" href="#">manage business</a> page to add a logo, a main photo and to edit any details of your business</li>
    <li>2) Then go to the <a class="theme-color" href="#">service plans</a> page to create service subscriptions for your business. Be sure to add photos</li>
    <li>3) Once you get some subscribers, if you require customers to check-in before using your service, go to your check-in page to confirm their check-in</li>
